3 States in Git:
------
Modified - changed, but not added/removed to be commited on next commit

Staged - Added/removed, will be included in the next commit

Committed

Sort of 4th state - Unknown, not known by Git.


Working Dir -> Staging -> .Git folder

git config --global init.defaultBranch main


Tracked or untracked state of file.

git status

git diff --staged

Adding the -a option to the git commit command makes Git automatically stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit, letting you skip the git add part:

git commit -a -m 'Add new benchmarks'
